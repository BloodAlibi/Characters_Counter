# Characters_Counter
**Characters Counter is a Python tool to count the number of characters of a given sentence.** For example, it will return 5 characters with an input "Hello". It will also indicate the numbers of each character, such as 1x"h", 1x"e", 1x"o" and 2x"l".

## How to use

Very easy. You simply enter the sentence you want, and it will return everything, such as :
- Numbers of characters
- How many of each (space and special characters included)

Find below an example of how to use it :

- Sentence entered : "Hi, I'm BloodAlibi !"

After using it once, the program will automatically ask for a new input, without deleting the past outputs.
